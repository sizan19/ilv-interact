# ilv-interact

A **NoPixel 5 (NoPixel V) inspired** interaction system for FiveM.

Walk up to something, look at it, press **E**. No third-eye menus, no clutter – just the same minimal in-world prompts you've seen on NoPixel V. Leave Stars on Github ⭐

## Features

- **Ring dots** on every nearby interaction point, so players can see everything they can interact with.
- **Crosshair hover** – a small centre-screen dot picks the in-range point closest to it. Move the camera to switch between points.
- **`[E] LABEL` prompt** in a condensed italic HUD font, drawn in-game (no NUI) so it stays locked to the world with no lag.
- **Multiple options per point** – scroll with the arrow keys or mouse wheel; the selected option carries the key badge.
- **`canInteract` filtering** – options that fail their check are hidden; points with nothing to show disappear.
- Coords, local entities, networked entities, entity bones and model-wide interactions.
- Auto-disables on death, NUI focus, in vehicles and while cuffed (configurable).
- Lightweight: ~44 KB of assets downloaded once, zero server-side work, a few sprite draws per frame.

## Installation

1. Place the folder in your resources directory and **name it `ilv-interact`** (the folder name is the resource name used by exports).
2. Make sure [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) starts first.
3. Add to your `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure ox_lib
   ensure ilv-interact
   ```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Camera / mouse | Hover the crosshair over a point |
| `E` | Use the selected option |
| `↑` / `↓` or mouse wheel | Change option when a point has several |

## How distances work

| Field | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `distance` | How close the player must be for the **dot** to appear | `8.0` (`10.0` for networked entities / bones) |
| `interactDst` | How close the player must be for the **prompt** to appear and `E` to work | `1.0` |
| `offset` | `vec3` offset from the entity the point is placed at | `vec3(0, 0, 0)` |

---

## Options

Every export takes an `options` list. Each option supports:

```lua
{
    name = 'my:option',       -- optional, used by RemoveInteractionOption and to replace an existing option
    label = 'Pickup Hot Dog - $25',
    canInteract = function(entity, coords, args)
        return true           -- return false to hide this option
    end,

    -- Pick ONE of the following (checked in this order):
    action = function(entity, coords, args) end,
    serverEvent = 'my:server:event', -- TriggerServerEvent(serverEvent, args)
    event = 'my:client:event',       -- TriggerEvent(event, option)

    args = { any = 'data' },
}
```

## Exports

All `Add*` exports take a single table. Because the resource name contains a hyphen, call exports with brackets: `exports['ilv-interact']`.

### AddInteraction

Adds a point at fixed coords. Returns the interaction id.

```lua
local id = exports['ilv-interact']:AddInteraction({
    coords = vec3(55.869, -1545.9351, 29.8501),
    distance = 2.0,
    interactDst = 1.0,
    name = 'laundromat_hack',
    options = {
        {
            label = 'Hack Security',
            event = 'sizan-robbery:client:UseBlueLaptop',
            canInteract = function()
                return true
            end,
        },
    },
})
```

### AddLocalEntityInteraction

Adds a point on a client-side (non-networked) entity. Returns the interaction id.

```lua
local id = exports['ilv-interact']:AddLocalEntityInteraction({
    entity = ped,
    offset = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.3),
    distance = 4.0,
    interactDst = 1.5,
    options = {
        {
            label = 'Talk',
            action = function(entity)
                print(('Talking to %s'):format(entity))
            end,
        },
    },
})
```

### AddEntityInteraction

Adds a point on a networked entity. `netId` accepts a network id or an entity handle; non-networked entities fall back to `AddLocalEntityInteraction`. Returns the interaction id.

```lua
local id = exports['ilv-interact']:AddEntityInteraction({
    netId = NetworkGetNetworkIdFromEntity(vehicle),
    distance = 5.0,
    interactDst = 1.5,
    options = {
        { label = 'Search Vehicle', serverEvent = 'my:server:searchVehicle' },
    },
})
```

### AddEntityBoneInteraction

Adds a point on an entity bone.

```lua
exports['ilv-interact']:AddEntityBoneInteraction({
    entity = vehicle,
    bone = 'boot',
    distance = 3.0,
    interactDst = 1.5,
    options = {
        { label = 'Open Trunk', action = function(entity) SetVehicleDoorOpen(entity, 5, false, false) end },
    },
})
```

### AddModelInteraction

Adds a point to every spawned object of the given models.

```lua
exports['ilv-interact']:AddModelInteraction({
    modelData = {
        { model = 'p_dumpster_t', offset = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0) },
        { model = 'prop_dumpster_02a', offset = vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0) },
    },
    distance = 8.0,
    interactDst = 1.0,
    options = {
        {
            label = 'Search Trash',
            action = function(entity, coords, args)
                SearchTrash(entity)
            end,
        },
    },
})
```

### Removing and updating

```lua
exports['ilv-interact']:RemoveInteraction(id)                  -- remove by id
exports['ilv-interact']:RemoveInteractionByEntity(entity)      -- remove everything on an entity
exports['ilv-interact']:RemoveInteractionOption(id, 'my:option') -- remove a single named option
exports['ilv-interact']:UpdateInteraction(id, newOptions)      -- replace the options list
```

Interactions are removed automatically when the resource that created them stops.

### Disable

```lua
exports['ilv-interact']:Disable(true)  -- hide and block all interactions
exports['ilv-interact']:Disable(false)
```

## Configuration

Everything lives in [`shared/settings.lua`](shared/settings.lua).
